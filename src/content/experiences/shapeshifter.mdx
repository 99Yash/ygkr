- Solely carried the refactor to a [**TurboRepo**](https://turbo.build/) multi-package workspace
- Rewrote ~50 LLM calls with strict type-safety and advanced error handling using [**Zod**](https://zod.dev/) + [**Vercel AI SDK**](https://ai-sdk.dev/)
- De-coupled a [**tRPC**](https://trpc.io/) API into its own service to be shared with a Chrome extension for type-safe API calls
- Integrated RAG and vector embeddings for custom LLM training on user's resources.
- Added support for referrals to bypass private access, while the application is not GA.
- Integrated [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for monitoring
